    title: "What are Arabic roots?",
    body: "Arabic words often grow from roots, usually three letters. The root س م ع carries the idea of hearing, and from it grow words like سَمِعَ (he heard), سامِع (listener), and مَسْمُوع (heard). Once you can see the root inside a word, Arabic vocabulary starts to feel connected instead of random.",
  },
  {
    title: "What is ṣarf?",
    body: "Ṣarf (صرف) is Arabic morphology — the study of how words are formed from roots using patterns. It explains why مَكْتَب means \"office\" and كاتِب means \"writer\": both come from the root ك ت ب (writing), shaped by different patterns. SarfMate shows you the most useful patterns first, without drowning you in technical terms.",
  },
  {
    title: "Why this fixed order of six forms?",
    body: "SarfMate always shows the same six forms in the same order: past verb, present verb, imperative, place noun / mim-masdar, active participle, and passive participle. A fixed order builds a mental habit — after a few roots, you will start predicting the forms before you see them. That is exactly the skill ṣarf students need.",
  },
  {
    title: "Why learners, meanings, and examples come first",
    body: "Many Arabic dictionaries and conjugators are built for advanced readers. SarfMate is built for English-speaking students. Every form has a plain English meaning and a short example sentence with its translation, so you always see the word working inside real Arabic.",
  },
  {
    title: "Why entries are reviewed",
    body: "Arabic morphology can vary by verb form, context, and usage. SarfMate entries are curated and reviewed over time. Each root carries a status badge — Reviewed, Community suggested, or AI draft — and individual forms that still need scholarly review are clearly marked, so you always know how much to trust what you see.",
  },
  {
    title: "How community corrections help",
    body: "If you notice an error or want a new root added, use the \"Notice an error\" button on any card or the \"Suggest a root\" button. Community suggestions are reviewed before publishing. Every correction makes SarfMate more reliable for the next student.",
